  To block IPs in nginx append the addresse(s) to block to:
    /etc/nginx/conf.d/blockips.conf

  Logging

reload.txt
  Reload nginx configuration
  Run service nginx reload or /etc/init.d/nginx reload

  It will do a hot reload of the configuration without downtime.
  If you have pending requests, then there will be lingering nginx  
  processes that will handle those connections before it dies, so
  it's an extremely graceful way to reload configs.
