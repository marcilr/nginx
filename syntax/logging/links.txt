Configuring Logging
This section describes how to configure logging of errors 
and processed requests in NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus.
https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/

Nginx, awstats and request time
How can I tune nginx to write request time to logs such that
awstats can show time taken for each request?
Also, how can I see requests by time taken in awstats?
As @Vladimir mentioned, to logs request time, edit your log_format directive as belows:
log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"'
                      ' $request_time';
and set the corresponding variables for LogFormat in awstats configuration file:
LogFormat="%host %other %host_r %time1 %methodurl %code %bytesd %refererquot %uaquot %other %extra1"
Here is an extra1 section example:

ExtraSectionName1="Time to serve requests (seconds)"
ExtraSectionCodeFilter1=""
ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitle1="Number of seconds to serve the request"
ExtraSectionFirstColumnValues1="extra1,(.*)"
ExtraSectionStatTypes1="H"
