Reload nginx configuration


Run service nginx reload or /etc/init.d/nginx reload

It will do a hot reload of the configuration without downtime.
If you have pending requests, then there will be lingering nginx
processes that will handle those connections before it dies, so
it's an extremely graceful way to reload configs.

Sometimes you may want to prepend with sudo
