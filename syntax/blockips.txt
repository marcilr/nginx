Block IPs


To block IPs in nginx append the addresse(s) to block to:
  /etc/nginx/conf.d/blockips.conf

For example to block 189.90.184.89:

# pwd
/etc/nginx/conf.d
# cat blockips.conf
...
# Block requested by Erik Bobo, Information Security Office, Tue Jan 22, 2019
# Oil & Gas reported SQL injection attacks.  Tracked in SDM Incident 143022
deny 189.90.184.89/24;
#

# /etc/init.d/nginx reload


NOTE: It will do a hot reload of the configuration without downtime.
If you have pending requests, then there will be lingering nginx
processes that will handle those connections before it dies, so it's
an extremely graceful way to reload configs.
